;;; Motivated by message Clojurians slack - message by Sky Higgins: https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C053AK3F9/p1658699721494909?thread_ts=1658652699.188059&cid=C053AK3F9
;; Java stores strings in UTF-16  (ignoring under-the hood optimizations). 
;; When count delegates to  .length, you get the number of UTF-16 code points in your string. 
;; * if all your code points will stay within U+0000-U+D7FF and U+E000-U+FFFD (think Latin-1 charset), then you can consider that the same as counting "chararcters".
;; * More likely, you will need to deal with surrogate pairs, where the the first of two points names a lookup table from which to interpret the second. 
;; * So the count of code points might be wildly different from your intuitive expectation
;;     * his Applies to all the emojis, to full support of most non-English languages, and to any support at all for most non-European languages. 
;;     * The complication goes even deeper, as many interpreted surrogate pairs still function merely as modifiers for other characters, e.g. diacritics or emoji skin tone colors... plus numerous other complications arising from different writing systems around the world.

(count "ahoj")

(count "Ã¡hÃ´j")
;; => 4
;; ... all is good so far - but now it gets weird - 5 instead of 4!
(count "ahoðŸš©")
;; => 5

;;;; This is alist of exercises that I intentionally left out
;;;; The idea is to revisit them after I finish the chapter
;;;; and try at least some of them; perhaps to verify my knowledge of the subject


;;; Ex. 2.20 (p. 104)?


;; Ex. 2.29 (p. 111)
;; binary mobile
;; This shouldn't be hard but I don't need to do every exercises the first time
